    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>My idea for a 3D web app project came from my pre-existing original characters, for which I have produced digital artwork in the past, as a hobby. I have had an interest in learning 3D modelling for fun for several years, so I struck upon the idea of modelling three of my OCs, and creating a showcase for these.</p>

<div class="text">
    <h2>3D Models</h2>
    <p>I produced nine 3D models in total: one for each character, then a further two each, which were copies of the same respective base model with a different animation.</p>
    <div class="imgs"><img src="bear1.png" alt="first bear model" width="330px" height="213.8px"><img src="cow1.png" alt="first cow model" width="330px" height="213.8px"><img src="blob1.png" alt="first blob model" width="330px" height="213.8px"></div>
    <p>Models and animations were produced in Blender, and the latter consisted of both keyframes and bone manipulation. Each 3D model was deliberately made with a low polygon count, allowing for a distinctive style without being too overwhelming to develop or load.</p>

    <h2>Design</h2>
    <p>This site has been designed with a unique, yet simple and easy-to-use interface. The home page contains three links to three separate carousels of web pages wherein the model and animations of each character can be observed. The canvas containing the 3D models in each of these web pages, enabled with three.js, takes up the entire web page, and navigational buttons are overlayed onto the canvas. CSS hover rules were used for all of these buttons to conditionally highlight text and make the design more responsive.</p>

    <h2>Interaction</h2>
    <p>This website offers orbital controls and interactive buttons on each model, allowing visitors to trigger three different animations on each character. The animations were designed to be amusing and engaging, and to fit well with the art style used for the characters. Each model also has an option for visitors to toggle a wireframe view of it with the click of a different button, giving a deeper insight into the construction of each model.</p>

    <h2>Implementation</h2>
    <p>During development, I received feedback on the lighting used for each model showcase, namely, that the models were not sufficiently visible from certain angles. I fixed this by adding a light source at the same point in 3D space as the camera.</p>
    <p>This website will be deployed and available on my personal web domain at <a href="https://threedee.cr0wbar.dev">https://threedee.cr0wbar.dev</a>.</p>

    <h2>Deeper understanding</h2>
    <p>This project was developed and deployed as a PHP website, and Blender was learned from scratch in order to create each model. It has also been deployed on my own personal web domain, with Caddy being used for web server hosting, rather than Apache or Nginx. Additionally, prior to undertaking this project, I had very little experience with JavaScript, and none at all with three.js, and this project has given me bountiful experience with both.</p>
